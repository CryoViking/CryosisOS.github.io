                The CryoDevs are a group of friends that develop projects together. 
                Everything from Mobile apps to Operating System routines. All that we 
                build, we build for fun and for the experience of learning. We 
                are starting to branch out into commercial work together, working on 
                small contracts that last for about 2-3 months.<br />
                We like to build content that is relevant and useful. Using modern tech stacks 
                and practices for developing products.

                We have several projects in the works right now but they are listed as private

                <b>List of Projects:</b><br />
                <b>- Presentation Suite</b><br />
                    This system involves a mobile app, electron app and a 
                    webserver technology. It allows the user to put together 
                    a presentation comprising of power points slides, videos and audio 
                    components all at the same time. The user can then project the presentation 
                    onto a screen and then have the option to control the presentation from 
                    any mobile device that is authorised with the presentation app on the 
                    local network.<br />
                <b>- Remote Light Control</b><br />
                    This system involves some electrical and electronic engineering. 
                    It involves placing an electronic switch in the pathway of a 240V 
                    circuit for a light switch circuit in a room. Connected to this 
                    electronic switch is a raspberry pi with a webserver on it that hosts 
                    an API that can then be utilised by a web browser or a mobile phone app. 
                    Allowing for remote control over the light switch. Custome built electrical-rated 
                    plastic components are also being designed and printed for use with the system.<br />
                <b>- Anime Web Player</b>-<br />
                    This project is little bit more of a hobby project. It basically uses an 
                    electron app framework to host a video player that plays anime episodes hosted on 
                    popular free websites like gogoanime or horriblesubs. The key feature to this is a 
                    in frame autoplay feature and episode navigation controls.<br /><br />
